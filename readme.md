# Science Fiction Convention Ontology
This ontology is the coursework of last year about module Semantic Web techs.
By some mistakes, I have misled it with the assignment of this year. 
## Inside this ontology:

###Classes:
####Programme Item, Room, Floor, Building, Panel Session, Play, Film Screening, Person,  Guest of Honour, Reading, Track and more.

###Defined Classes:
1. A reading by a guest of honour. 
2. A panel session with both male and female participants.
3. A film screening thatâ€™s part more than one track. 
4. A programme item longer than 90 minutes. 
5. A person who both moderates and participates in panel sessions.

####In addition, there are also some instances data to demostrate the behaviour of defined class, and SPARQL queries.
